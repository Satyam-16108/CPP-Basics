India is considered one of the potential superpowers of the world.
This potential is attributed to several indicators, the primary ones being its demographic trends and a rapidly expanding economy and military.
India became the world's fastest growing economy with a 5% estimated GDP rate.
 Before it can be considered a superpower, the country must overcome many economic, social, 
and political problems and it also needs to be as influential on the international stage when compared to the United States, 
China and the former Soviet Union.
